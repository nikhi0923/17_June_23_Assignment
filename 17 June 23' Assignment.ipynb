    "\n",
    "a. EOFError: This error occurs when the built-in function input() reaches the end of a file (EOF) or encounters an unexpected end of input. It's raised when you try to read input from the user or a file, and the input is abruptly terminated without reaching a valid input value.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. FloatingPointError: This error occurs when an operation involving floating-point numbers cannot be performed correctly. It might happen during arithmetic operations like division by zero or when performing mathematical operations that result in a value that is too large to be represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. IndexError: This error occurs when you try to access an index of a sequence (such as a list or string) that is outside the valid range of indices. It typically happens when you access an index that is negative or greater than or equal to the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. MemoryError: This error occurs when the Python interpreter runs out of memory while trying to allocate memory for a new object. It might happen when you're working with large data sets or performing memory-intensive operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. OverflowError: This error occurs when a mathematical operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum representable value for a numeric type. For example, trying to calculate a factorial for a very large number that can't fit within the available memory space can raise an OverflowError.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. TabError: This error occurs when there is an issue with the indentation in your code, particularly when mixing tabs and spaces inconsistently. Python requires consistent indentation, either using tabs or spaces, but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. ValueError: This error occurs when a built-in operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value. For example, trying to convert a string to an integer using the int() function, but the string doesn't represent a valid integer, would raise a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "These error types are part of Python's exception hierarchy, and they provide information about what went wrong during the execution of a program. Understanding the specific error types can help you troubleshoot and handle errors more effectively in your code.\n",
